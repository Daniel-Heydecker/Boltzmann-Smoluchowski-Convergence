\section{Convergence of the Stochastic Coalescent}
For stochastic coalescent \cite{A99}, this has jump rate $N$ times larger than for the stochastic coagulant (Marcus--Lushnikov process \cite{L78}) see \cite{N00}.

We recall that $d_0$ is a metric inducing the vague topology $\mathcal{F}(C_c(S))$ on $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_{\le 1}(S)$ 
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma: local uniform convergence of stochastic coagulent} Use ideas of \cite{N99} to show that \begin{equation}
\end{equation} in probability, for any $t\geq 0$.\end{lemma} \begin{proof} To be done later \end{proof}
