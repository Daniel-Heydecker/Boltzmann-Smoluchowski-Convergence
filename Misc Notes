I'd propose to structure as follows:

1. Basic analysis of the Smoluchowski equation

2. Local uniform convergence of the stochastic coalescent (vague topology, no gel)

3. Introduction to random graphs

4. Coupling of the stochastic coalescent to a random graph process. Basic analysis of the survival function \rho_t, a_t, b_t.

5. Finiteness of the second moment \mathcal{E} after t_gel. Includes formula for M_t, E_t in terms of \rho_t, strictly after t_gel, and continuity on (t_gel, \infty).

6. Integral equation for M_t, E_t, strictly after tgel.

8. Finite size-biasing effect.

7. Uniform convergence of the mass, momentum and energy of the stochastic gel. Upgrade (2) to uniform convergence.
